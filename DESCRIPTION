Maintainer: Mallory J Flynn <mallory.flynn@stat.ubc.ca>
Description: When many possible multiplier method estimates of a target
    population are available, a weighted sum of estimates from each
    back-calculated path can be achieved with this package.
    Variance-minimizing weights are used and with any admissible
    tree-structured data.
